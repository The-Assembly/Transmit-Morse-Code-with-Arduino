# Transmit-Morse-Code-with-Arduino
When Samuel Morse invented the telegraph in 1838, he also devised an alphabet for communication over his revolutionary system that came to be known as Morse Code. This was a major milestone in early telecommunications, enabling encrypted messaging that would eventually evolve into our modern-day Internet. Though superseded by other technology, Morse Code is still of keen interest to amateur radio enthusiasts and has utility in aeronautics and navigation - often used by ships at sea for light-based communication. 

In this session, we’ll show you how to encrypt text into Morse Code using the Arduino and then communicate it through light and sound via associated hardware.  This simple encoder can easily be modified for communication across media such as Bluetooth, with a similar decoder setup to complete our messaging cycle.
